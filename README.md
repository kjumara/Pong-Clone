# Pong Clone - README

Welcome to the **Pong**! This is a modern take on the classic Pong game, created using **Godot**. In this single-player version, you face off against a progressively challenging AI opponent. The objective is simple: score points by getting the ball past the AI's paddle. As you score, the AI's difficulty increases, and power-ups add an extra layer of complexity to the game.

## Game Overview

In **Pong Clone**, players engage in fast-paced matches on a single screen, controlling a paddle to intercept the ball and outmaneuver the AI opponent. The objective is to score the most points by getting the ball past the AI's paddle. The AI's difficulty increases every 3 points scored, keeping the gameplay challenging and dynamic. 

To make things even more interesting, power-ups randomly appear during the match, adding an extra layer of complexity to the gameplay. The game ends when the AI scores 5 points, and your final score is displayed to determine the winner.
